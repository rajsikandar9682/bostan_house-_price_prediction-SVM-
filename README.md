# Boston House Price Prediction using SVM

This project uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) — a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm — to predict house prices based on various features in the Boston Housing Dataset.
To improve the model’s accuracy and performance, feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler.


# # Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that can predict housing prices in the Boston area based on input features like:

Average number of rooms per dwelling

Crime rate per capita

Accessibility to highways

Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

And many more

By applying Support Vector Regression (SVR) and feature scaling, this model achieves a better understanding of data trends and relationships.
